# PopTheBubbles
PopTheBubbles is a skill game based on pygame. The game was programmed as part of a school assignment.

# Game principle
The principle is quite simple. Click as quickly as possible on all the bubbles that appear. If you hit one it will burst. You get a certain number of points for each bubble, which depends on the size of the bubble.

The game principle is basically infinite, depending on the game time, the difficulty level becomes more difficult, so that more bubbles appear and they grow faster.
